# Task-06_CyberSecurityIntern
🎯 Objective

The objective of this task is to understand what makes a password strong by creating different passwords, testing them with an online password strength checker (e.g., passwordmeter.com
), and learning best practices for secure password creation.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Password Strength Checker: passwordmeter.com
- Tested Passwords: Created with varying complexity

## 🔑 Password Testing
### 1. Weak Password Example
- Password: hello4545
- Result:
    - Score: 49%
    - Feedback: Too short, dictionary-based, predictable, no symbols/uppercase
- Analysis: Easy to guess using brute force or dictionary attack

### 2. Very Strong Password Example
- Password: S3cure!Pa$$wOrd2025
- Result:
    - Score: 100%
    - Feedback: Excellent password — long (19 chars), random, uses all character classes
- Analysis: Nearly impossible to brute force in reasonable time, highly secure

## 📚 Best Practices Learned
1.Length matters – Aim for at least 12–16 characters. Longer passwords take exponentially longer to crack.

2.Mix character types – Use uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

3.Avoid dictionary words – Don’t use names, birthdays, or common words.

4.Randomness is key – Use passphrases or password managers to generate secure random strings.

5.Unique per account – Don’t reuse the same password across different services.

6.Use passphrases – Example: S3cure!Pa$$wOrd2025 (easy to remember, hard to crack).


## ⚔️ Common Password Attacks & Impact of Complexity
- Brute Force Attack: Tries all combinations; longer + complex passwords exponentially increase cracking time.
- Dictionary Attack: Uses common words/passwords; easily defeated by randomness and symbols.
- Credential Stuffing: Reuses stolen passwords; mitigated by unique passwords per account.

## 📝 Conclusion
From the evaluation, it is clear that password complexity and length directly affect security. Weak passwords like `hello4545``` are cracked in seconds, while complex ones like ```S3cure!Pa$$wOrd2025``` are nearly uncrackable.
The best approach is to create long, random, unique passwords and manage them using a password manager.
